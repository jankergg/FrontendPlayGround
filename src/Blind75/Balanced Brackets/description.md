Given a string str consisting of characters such as `'(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']'`, determine if the input string is properly balanced.

A string is considered balanced if:

Each opening bracket bracket is closed by the same type of bracket (e.g., ( with ), { with }, and [ with ])
Open brackets are closed in the correct order (e.g., ([]) is valid, but ([)] is not)
Any subset of brackets enclosed within a matched pair must also form a valid matched pair (e.g., {[(])} is not balanced because the contents inside { and } are unbalanced).
Input
`str: string`: A string

### Examples
> Input: str = "[]"
Output: true
Explanation: The string contains correctly paired and ordered parentheses.

> Input: str = "([)]"
Output: false
Explanation: The string contains correctly paired but incorrectly ordered parentheses.

> Input: str = "([]){}"
Output: true
Explanation: The string contains correctly paired and ordered parentheses.

### Constraints
- 1 <= strs.length <= 1000
- The string str contains only the characters (, ), {, }, [ and ]
